# Cyclistic Bike Share Case Study

This repository contains my capstone project for the Google Career Certificate in Data Analytics.

## The file contents are as follows:

* BikeShareCaseStudy.Rmd: The R Markdown file containing the R code used for my analysis

* BikeShareCaseStudy.pdf: The R Markdown report knitted into PDF for more accessible viewing

* cyclisticData: A folder containing the raw data provided by the course that was used for the case study. The organizational structure of the folder is further elaborated upon in the final report.
